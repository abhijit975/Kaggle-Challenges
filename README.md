## Titanic-Kaggle-Challenge
This is my attempt on the Titanic Machine Learning challenge in Kaggle to predict whether a person on board the Titanic survived or died. This uses a grid-search RandomForestClassifier with an accuracy score of 80% which is in the top 4% of the leaderboard.

### Files:

1. train.csv: Datafile for training. Details about this dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview
2. test.csv: Dataset for predicting the survival of passengers.
3. Titanic_RF.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for my solution. Includes feature engineering, cleaning dataset, logistic regression, and random forest algorithm.

## Breast-cancer prediction
This is my attempt on the Topcoder Breast Cancer Prediction Challenge where I finished in the top 10 in the leaderboard. In the two notebooks, I have used logistic regression, random forest, and SVC to find the best accuracy.

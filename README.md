# Titanic-Kaggle-Challenge
This is my attempt on the Titanic Machine Learning challenge in Kaggle to predict whether a person on-board the Titanic survived or died. This uses a gridsearch RandomForestClassifier with accuracy score 80% which is in the top 4% of the leaderboard.

### Files:

1. train.csv: Datafile for training. Details about this dataset can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview
2. test.csv: Dataset for predicting survival of passengers.
3. Titanic_RF.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for my solution. Includes feature engineering, cleaning dataset, logistic regression and random forest algorithm.
